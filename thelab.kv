AnchorLayoutExample:

<AnchorLayoutExample>:
    anchor_x: "left"  # right, left, center (center is the default)
    anchor_y: "top"  # bottom, top, center (center is the default)
    Button:
        text: "A"
        size_hint: .1, .1

    # there is no stacking for widgets

<BoxLayoutExample>
    orientation: "horizontal"
    Button:
        text: "A"
        size_hint: .5, .5  # this gives 80% of the width and 50% of the height compared to the other buttons
        # size_hint: .5, None # these are relative. You want 100% of width
        height: "60dp" # here, you have fixed the height to 60dp, regardless of any shifts in the window.
        pos_hint: {"center_y": .5}  # on the x axis, you're "starting" at the 75% line (the middle). 
                                    # If you gave it "1," it would be completely outside the window.
